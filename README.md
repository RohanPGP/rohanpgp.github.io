      World War I[j] or the First World War (28 July 1914 â€“ 11 November 1918) was a global conflict fought between two coalitions: the Allies and the Central Powers. Battles took place throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest wars in history, it ultimately resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23 million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from numerous causes. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.
